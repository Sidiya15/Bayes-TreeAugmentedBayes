# Bayes-TreeAugmentedBayes

This project was conducted as a part of the evaluation of the graphical models class. The idea was to put in evidance the efficiency of the Tree Augmented Naive Bayes 
algorithm (TAN) over the Naive Bayes algorithm (NB) in the gaussian case. The idea was that if Naive Bayes, despite its incorrect independence assumption, works well, so taking into account an eventual correlations between features, the performance of the classification can only be improved. This model maintains the structure of the Naive Bayes graph and increases it by adding edges between the variables in order to capture the correlations between some of them. By constraint of complexity, the TAN imposes a restriction on the level of interaction between the variables to one. Therefore, in a TAN graph, each variable can have two parents which are the class node and another variable node, except for the root variable which has only the class node as parent. Another important element in the conception of the TAN is the choice of the tree construction. For such purpose, we chose to use the Kruskal algorithm to construct the maximum spanning tree with regrd to the mutual information between each to pair of feature which in the case of normality assumption goes back to computing
I(X, Y)= 0.5*log(1-p<sup></sup>) where <b>p</b> is the Pearson correlation coefficient between (X, Y).
